# How to Read a Book, v5.0

> Paul N. Edwards



How can you learn the most from a book — or any other piece of writing — when you're readingfor information, rather than for pleasure?

It’s satisfying to start at the beginning and read straight through to the end. Some books, such asnovels, have to be read this way, since a basic principle of fiction is to hold the reader insuspense. Your whole purpose in reading fiction is to follow the writer’s lead, allowing him orher to spin a story bit by bit.

But many of the books, articles, and other documents you’ll read during your undergraduateand graduate years, and possibly during the rest of your professional life, won’t be novels.Instead, they’ll be non-fiction: textbooks, manuals, journal articles, histories, academic studies,and so on.

The purpose of reading things like this is to gain, and retain, information. Here, finding out whathappens — as quickly and easily as possible — is your main goal. So unless you’re stuck in prisonwith nothing else to do, NEVER read a non-fiction book or article from beginning to end.

Instead, when you’re reading for information, you should ALWAYS jump ahead, skip around, anduse every available strategy to discover, then to understand, and finally to remember what thewriter has to say. This is how you’ll get the most out of a book in the smallest amount of time.

Using the methods described here, you should be able to read a 300-page book in six to eighthours. Of course, the more time you spend, the more you’ll learn and the better you’llunderstand the book. But your time is limited.

Here are some strategies to help you do this effectively. Most of these can be applied not onlyto books, but also to any other kind of non-fiction reading, from articles to websites. Table 1, onthe next page, summarizes the techniques, and the following pages explain them in more detail.



## Read the whole thing!



In reading to learn, your goal should always be to get all the way through the assignment.It’s much more important to have a general grasp of the arguments or hypotheses,evidence, and conclusions than to understand every detail. In fact, no matter how carefullyyou read, you won’t remember most of the details anyway.

What you can do is remember and record the main points. And if you remember those, youknow enough to find the material again if you ever do need to recall the details.
